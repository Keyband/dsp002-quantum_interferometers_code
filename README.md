# Data Science Project #003 - Quantum Interferometers

A minor project, made for a college assignment (the PDF is included, but it's in portuguese). In these notebooks I use [QISKit](https://github.com/QISKit) to simulate a Quantum Computer, and then run algorithms analogous to a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, as explored in [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.5951) paper. Be aware that depending on some of the parameters, the notebooks might take quite a while to process.
